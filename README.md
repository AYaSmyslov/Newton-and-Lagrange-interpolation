# Newton-and-Lagrange-interpolation
The program implements two approaches of function interpolation. The Newton polynomial and the Lagrange interpolation polynomial.
The program was created using WinAPI.
The functionality of the program allows you not only to get the interpolated value of the function, but also to plot the interpolated function -
all this happens on the basis of known arguments and values of the function
